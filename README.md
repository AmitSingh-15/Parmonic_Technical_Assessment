Parmonic Technical Assessment
1 Unit Testing

Write a C# console application that accepts an integer i, and prints an output based on the following:

i is divisible by 3 Print Fizz

i is divisible by 5 Print Buzz

i is divisible by both 3 and 5 Print FizzBuzz

Write unit tests. i could take any legal integer value.

2 ASP NET rate-limiting middleware

Write a custom ASP.NET Core middleware to perform IP-address based rate-limiting. The middleware should not allow more than 10 requests per second per IP address.

Hardcoding values is ok.

3 Data Modelling

Write a set of DDD entity & value-object classes in C# to represent a simple single-entry ledger. Example. Include validation code.

Create a README file explaining it. You may also describe shortcomings

4 Design

You are in-charge of developing a new backend (no UI) microservice to maintain a single-entry ledger. Write a detailed README file to describe:

· The microservice’s proposed design. Include a block diagram.

· How other services should communicate with this one.

· How it should be deployed to a cloud of your choice.

· Possible roadblocks, questions, unclear requirements.

· Shortcomings of the proposed design.
